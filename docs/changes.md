# Changes

## Kunai

Fundamentally, 30 damage is just too low to matter. Compare Doubletake to something like Thunder: you deal 60 damage rather than 100, and it's harder to aim, to boot. 50 damage is enough that getting kunai is nice even if you don't have kunai synergy.

## Blade Bay

The fundamental appeal of Blade Bay is that you can throw it down in a small deck, and it'll continue to provide value as you play. It does 80 damage, which is actually quite a lot, given the AOE and low mana cost; however, its low HP means it will likely die before it can provide much help.

50 -> 80 (landing damage; this is still terrible but it's more appealing numerologically)
HP: 80 -> 150
HP if fragile: 150 -> 300
Consume (it's bad in multiples, so this should pretty much be a buff)

## Step Pierce

80 -> 130

This might not be enough.

## Step Slash

80 -> 130

## Collect Ring

Collect Ring might need a nerf after kunai were buffed, since it was decent already. We'll see.

## Guillotine

80 -> 100
300 -> 400

## Lifesword

30 -> 10
-Consume

## Warpath
120 -> 170

# Rarities

Slashfik has an excessive number of high-rarity spells. especially Calamities. Ex:

Slashfik: 4/5/3/4/6
Anima: 7/12/10/1/2
Glimmer: 2/6/4/7/1
Hexawan: 5/12/5/4/0
Phalanx: 2/7/5/3/0

I'd like to get Slashfik to be something more like:

4/5/6/5/2
which is -4 Calamities, +1 Legendary, +3 Epic

if I had to pick two calamities for Slashfik, I'd pick Scavenge and Bladeskrieg; they feel the most impressive. (Note that this is different from picking the two strongest Calamities.)

That leaves us with 8 legendary spells, whereas we want only 5. So we need to downgrade 3 to Epic. Let's hit:

Fury
Vivisection
Guillotine

In short, Fury, Vivisection and Guillotine are now Epic. Excalibur, Lifesword and Warpath are now Legendary.
